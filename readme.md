shikanji is a static site generator which uses markdown files for content.

It uses showdownjs to parse the markdown posts into html. shikanji is fast, lightweight and works well with smaller screen sizes.

To build on your local system, run npm start

The posts are divided by sections kept in sub-directories within the_posts directory.The_pages directory contains the navigation pages. which will create a _site subdirectory which contains the built site.

The styling is kept minimal and can be changed by modifying the main.css file in the assets/css subdirectory.
